The `surreal` package seeks to implement the methods inside the paper 
"Residual Sur(Realism)" by [Leonard A. Stefanski](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~stefansk/) (doi:10.1198/000313007X190079). These methods allow for hiding images inside of residual plots.

## Installation

You can install the development version of surreal from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("coatless-rpkg/surreal")
```

## Example

To begin, first load the package:

```{r}
#| label: load-library
library(surreal)
```

Next, we'll retrieve R logo image included with the package:

```{r}
#| label: load-logo
# Load the R logo data included with the package
data <- r_logo_example()

# Display original data
plot(data, pch = 16, main = "Original data")
```

We can see that the data is in a 2D format. 

```{r}
#| label: logo-data-summary
str(data)
summary(data)
```

We can apply the surreal method to the data:

```{r}
#| label: apply-surreal-method
# Apply the surreal method to the data
transformed_surreal_data <- surreal(data)
```

After applying the surreal method, we get a series of additional predictors
that when visualized against `y` look as if they are no underlying patterns.

```{r}
#| label: surreal-method-data-pair-plot
# View the expanded data after transformation
pairs(y ~ ., data = transformed_surreal_data, main = "Data after transformation")
```

Finally, we'll fit a linear model to the transformed data and plot the residuals:

```{r}
#| label: surreal-method-residual-plot
# Fit a linear model to the transformed data
model <- lm(y ~ ., data = transformed_surreal_data)

# Plot the residuals
plot(model$fitted, model$resid, type = "n", main = "Residual plot from transformed data")
points(model$fitted, model$resid, pch = 16)
```

From the residual plot, we get back our original R logo that has a slight
border around it to improve the original image recovery.
